# Small-Business-Loans

# Jupyter notebooks and other materials for the second project in my data science course, investigating disbursement amounts and paid off/defaulted on status of small business loans.

#Dataset was too large to upload here, but is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied . In addition to the csv file, my team made use of the informative PDF and sector legend included.

#My teammate Sherry cleaned the data and analyzed factors affecting loan defaults in the Cleaned_Data and Sherry_Default notebooks. My other teammate Emerie analyzed how factors affect loan amounts, and created a linear regression model to predict how much disbursement a business will receive. I created a logistical model to predict whether borrowers will default on their loans or pay them in full.
