Talk about the parts you think will be difficult (doing the modeling? preparing the data? keeping team members on-task?) and how you plan to address them. Specifically list out goals for yourself in terms of these challenges. I will check in with you throughout the semester on how you are progressing with these goals in order to help you succeed. Talk about why each team member was given each of their duties and responsibilities. Talk about your overall goals for the project. What are the things you are hoping to accomplish for this project to be considered a success? Is it an accuracy goal? Is it being able to explain a complex question in an easy way? Is it to add new insight to an important problem? Be as specific as possible. During your final presentation I will be looking for whether or not you achieved these goals, so they must be clearly defined and not overly broad."],"metadata":{"id":"V6gc4aX26uKZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Approved by Dr. Savala on: XX/XX/XXXX"],"metadata":{"id":"vVcSFuoXmmiy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["I'm really excited to work with my team. The most difficult part of the project will be modeling predictions. The best way to address this issue will be to help each other when an issue occurs. Another difficulty we might face is the amount of time we have to complete this project. I plan to schedule a time we can meet to work together on the project. Also, remind our team to be communicating what we're working on. I didn't want to micromanage the team so we openly talked about what we wanted to work on. The main goal I want to set for this project is to make sure our presentation is cohesive. This can be easily attained and I have full faith that my team can accomplish this goal."],"metadata":{"id":"1SzEtGzNjT-G"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Yk7cqReAl3_q"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
